  "architectural_notes": [
    "Android-first app with secure data handling, fast loading, and scalable architecture for future modules (agent/admin/payments/renewals).",
    "Rewards/cashback should be modeled as a promotional 'Reward Benefit' credited only after policy issuance confirmation from insurer/partner.",
    "UI requirements: professional trust-based finance style (blue/white), clean iconography, and bottom navigation.",
    "Localization requirement: Hindi + English support.",
    "Regulatory requirement: IRDAI-compliant language; include clear disclaimers that the app is a facilitator and cashback is promotional (no guaranteed return claims).",
    "Branding decision: App name is \"Ayushmaan Bazar\"; update app title, splash screen title, logo text, and documentation accordingly.",
    "App positioning change: operate strictly as an insurance facilitator/lead-generation platform (no direct policy purchase, no premium collection, no “Buy Now” flows).",
    "Neutral multi-insurer presentation: do not promote or prioritize any single insurer; use generic product cards and informational wording.",
    "CTA restriction: only allow “Get Quote” and “Request Call Back” (and informational “Know More/View Details”); avoid direct selling language.",
    "Add outbound notification integrations triggered on successful Call Back submission (Telegram Bot API now; keep message templates parameterized with lead fields and submission time)."
